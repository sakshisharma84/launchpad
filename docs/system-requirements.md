# System Requirements

Mirantis Launchpad is a static binary that works on following operating systems:

* Linux (x64)
* MacOS (x64)
* Windows (x64)

## System Requirements for UCP Clusters

### Supported Operating Systems

* CentOS 7
* CentOS 8
* Ubuntu 18.04.x
* Redhat Enterprise Linux 7.x
* Redhat Enterprise Linux 8.x
* Windows Server 2019

### Hardware Requirements

#### Minimum

* 8GB of RAM for manager nodes
* 4GB of RAM for worker nodes
* 2 vCPUs for manager nodes
* 10GB of free disk space for the /var partition for manager nodes (A minimum of 6GB is recommended.)

#### Recommended for Production

* 16GB of RAM for manager nodes
* 4 vCPUs for manager nodes
* 25-100GB of free disk space

Note that Windows container images are typically larger than Linux container images. For this reason, you should provision more local storage for Windows nodes.

### Remote management

Launchpad will connect to Linux machines via SSH and to Windows machines via SSH or WinRM. Thus, SSH or WinRM is required to be enabled on host machines. Only passwordless sudo capable SSH Key-Based authentication is supported. On Windows the user needs to have Administrator privileges.

#### Windows Machines

##### SSH

To enable SSH easily on Windows machines, you can look the following PowerShell snippets and modify them for your own needs and run it on each Windows machine:

```
# Install OpenSSH
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0
Start-Service sshd
Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType 'Automatic'
# Configure ssh key authentication
mkdir c:\Users\Administrator\.ssh\
$sshdConf = 'c:\ProgramData\ssh\sshd_config'
(Get-Content $sshdConf).replace('#PubkeyAuthentication yes', 'PubkeyAuthentication yes') | Set-Content $sshdConf
(Get-Content $sshdConf).replace('Match Group administrators', '#Match Group administrators') | Set-Content $sshdConf
(Get-Content $sshdConf).replace('       AuthorizedKeysFile __PROGRAMDATA__/ssh/administrators_authorized_keys', '#       AuthorizedKeysFile __PROGRAMDATA__/ssh/administrators_authorized_keys') | Set-Content $sshdConf
restart-service sshd
```

After that you need to transfer your SSH public key from your local machine to host machines:

```
# Transfer SSH Key to Server
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub Administrator@1.2.1.2:C:\Users\Administrator\.ssh\authorized_keys
ssh --% Administrator@1.2.1.2 powershell -c $ConfirmPreference = 'None'; Repair-AuthorizedKeyPermission C:\Users\Administrator\.ssh\authorized_keys
```

##### WinRM

PowerShell Remoting over WinRM can be also used on Windows hosts as an alternative to SSH. To read more about how to manage Windows machines over WinRM: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/portal

### Ports Used

When installing a UCP cluster, a series of ports need to be opened to incoming traffic. See [UCP documentation](https://docs.mirantis.com/docker-enterprise/v3.1/dockeree-products/ucp/install-ucp.html#ports-used) for more details.
