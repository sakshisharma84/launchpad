# Bootstrapping UCP cluster on Azure

This directory provides an example flow for using Mirantis Launchpad with Terraform and Azure.

## Prerequisites

* An account and credentials for Azure.
* Terraform [installed](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install)

## Steps

1. Create terraform.tfvars file with needed details. You can use the provided terraform.tfvars.example as a baseline.
2. `terraform init`
3. `terraform apply`
4. `terraform output ucp_cluster > launchpad.yaml`
5. `launchpad apply`

## Notes

1. If any Windows workers are created then a random password will be generated for the admin account `DockerAdmin` that is created.
2. Only Linux workers are added to the LoadBalancer created for workers.
3. Both RDP and WinRM ports are opened for Windows workers.
4. A default storage account is created for kubernetes.
5. The number of Fault & Update Domains varies depending on which Azure Region you're using. A list can be found [here](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/includes/managed-disks-common-fault-domain-region-list.md). The Fault & Update Domain values are used in the Availability Set definitions.
6. **Windows worker nodes need to be rebooted after engine install, which must be done manually until version 1.1 is released**
